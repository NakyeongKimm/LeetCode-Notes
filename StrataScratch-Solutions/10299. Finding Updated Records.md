# 10299. Finding Updated Records

## 📝 Problem Description
We have a table with employees and their salaries, however, some of the records are old and contain outdated salary information. Find the current salary of each employee assuming that salaries increase each year. Output their id, first name, last name, department ID, and current salary. Order your list by employee ID in ascending order.

## 💡 SQL Solution
### Approach
- Get the highest salary record per employee id
	- To do so, partition by id first
	- get row number using ROW_NUMBER() and only use the first row
### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n \log n)$
	- arrangement(including ranking): $O(n \log n)$
	- subquery filtering: $O(n)$
	- final arrangement: $O(m \log m)$ where m < n (m: final outputs only)
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$
	- Use all data points

```sql
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, department_id, salary
FROM (
    SELECT *, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY salary DESC, 
    department_id DESC) AS rn
    FROM ms_employee_salary) s
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER by id ASC;
```

## 📓Reflections
- new functions: ROW_NUMBER(), PARTITION BY
- get used to using alias
