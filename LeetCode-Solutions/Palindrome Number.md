# Palindrome Number

## 📝 Problem Description
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.     Example 1:  Input: x = 121 Output: true Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left. Example 2:  Input: x = -121 Output: false Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome. Example 3:  Input: x = 10 Output: false Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.    Constraints:  -231 <= x <= 231 - 1    Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
